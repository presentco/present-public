<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Warranty Disclaimers</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Services are provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting the foregoing, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Indemnity</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You will indemnify and hold harmless Bubble and its officers, directors, employee and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Services or Content, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Limitation of Liability</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NEITHER Bubble NOR ANY OTHER party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES arising ouT of or in connection with thESE TERMS or from the use OF or inability to use the Service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), PRODUCT LIABILITY or any other legal theory, and whether or not Bubble has been informed of the possibility of such damage, EVEN IF A limited REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PUrPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In no event will Bubble’S total liability arising out of or in connection with THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE the ServiceS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO BUBBLE FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BUBBLE, AS APPLICABLE.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN BUBBLE AND YOU.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Dispute Resolution</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Governing Law</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agreement to Arbitrate</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You and Bubble agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “<b>IP Protection Action</b>”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Bubble with written notice of your desire to do so by email at <a href="mailto:support@bubble.network"><span class="s2">support@present.network</span></a> within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an “<b>Arbitration Opt-out Notice</b>”). If you don’t provide Bubble with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Bubble with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Bubble with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <b>you acknowledge and agree that you and Bubble are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</b> Further, unless both you and Bubble otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arbitration Rules</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><span class="s2">www.adr.org/arb_med</span></a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arbitration Process</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general <a href="https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><span class="s2">Demand for Arbitration</span></a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unless you and Bubble otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Bubble submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arbitrator’s Decision</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Bubble will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fees</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Bubble will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Changes</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if Bubble changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:support@bubble.network"><span class="s2">support@present.network</span></a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Bubble’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Bubble in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>General Terms</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Bubble and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Bubble and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Dispute Resolution” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Bubble’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Bubble may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any notices or other communications provided by Bubble under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bubble’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Bubble. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</span></p>
