Alter formerly worked with the Daniel Patterson Group for three years at the helm of kitchens such as Haven and Plum in Oakland, California. Prior to that, she has worked in some of the Bay Area's most notable restaurant kitchens including Manresa, Ubuntu, Aqua, and Acquerello. \n\nAlter’s menus showcase a commitment to technique, whole animal cookery, and support of local farms. Her food often takes familiar dishes to new places with creatives pins on classics. Alter earned a Food & Wine Magazine nomination for People’s Best Chef in 2012 and 2013 with her talent for bringing “down-to- earth boldness to cerebral dishes.” She won the title of “Best New Chef” from Oakland Magazine while at Haven, which was also named “Best New Restaurant” under her direction and awarded three stars from San Francisco Magazine. She grew up in Laguna Beach, California and is a graduate of the California Culinary Academy.\n\nNightbirdRestaurant.com"

      "description": "We are a social justice enterprise that empowers women of color to be their bold, powerful, and free selves through wearable political art. We produce fashion accessories, house wares, and organizational swag that inspire community to take a stand for what they believe. \n\nHope Lehman\n\nI am a biracial hip hop feminist dedicated to community empowerment and ending all forms of oppression through action, dialogue, technology and art. I was born in Sacramento, California and graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2009 with a degree in Feminist Studies and Sociology. I have lived in Oakland since the fall of 2010 and am honored to be a part of the vibrant local art, entrepreneurship, and tech community. You can find me haunting the downtown streets of Oakland taking over the dance floor or tinkering away in my art studio next to a good sci-fi flick. \n\nhttp://freshtodefcollective.com/"
