Privacy Policy</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Last
Updated: 12/14/2017</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Protecting
your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this
Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure
of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does
not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they
are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a
term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy
have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that
you have read and understand our Terms of Service.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Revisions
to this Privacy Policy</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Any
information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy
in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy
Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy
Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by
sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated
Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Collection
and Use of Information</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Collected or Received from You</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Our
primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our
Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if
you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our
Services.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Account
Information. If you create an Account, we may collect certain information that
can be used to identify you, such as your phone number (“<b>PII</b>”). If you
create an Account through the Services, we may also collect other information
that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you,
such as your Present User ID.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain
information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information
as “<b>Log Data</b>”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders
(either, a “<b>User</b>”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s
Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, the pages or features of our
Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features,
the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use
Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third
parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by
expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’
needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate,
non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile
device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings
and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use
of our Services.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Location
Information. When you use our App, we may collect and store information about
your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by
accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable
location services on your device. We may use location information to improve
and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location
information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
that We Share with Third Parties</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>We
will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as
described below:</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Shared with other Users. As part of our Services, you may communicate with
other Users using the chat functionality of the Services. When you participate
in a chat session, the content of your communications will be visible and
available to any User participating in that session. We encourage you to use
your judgment in communicating and sharing information with other Users.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services
providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These
third-party services providers will only have access to anonymized data for the
purpose of performing services on our behalf.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and
non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and
analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>We
utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. that we use to
gather information about how Users engage with our Site and Services. For more
information about Google Analytics, please visit <a

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect
from our Users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if
we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger,
acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the
event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets,
including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer
in connection with the transaction.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Information
Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with
government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and
comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or
law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion,
believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process
(including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the
property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and
(iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally
actionable activity.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Your
Choices</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>We
offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and
we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to
provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of
the features of the Services.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Opt-Out.
We may periodically send you free communications that directly promote the
Services or other services offered by Present. When you receive such
promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out”
by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication you
receive. We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services
and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g.,
communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy
or information about your Account.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Modifying
Your Information. You can access and modify the PII associated with your
Account by deleting an image by using the delete icon when viewing an image you
shared. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us
at <a href="mailto:support@present.co"><span class=s2>support@present.co</span></a>
with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can,
but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as
otherwise required by law.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Responding
to Do Not Track Signals</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Our
Services do not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals
received from various web browsers.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>The
Security of Your Information</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>We
take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to
protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII)
from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive
information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies.
Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the
Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot
guarantee the absolute security of any information.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><b><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Links
to Other Sites</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Our
Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated
by third parties (each, a “<b>Third-party Service</b>”). Any information that
you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a
Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party
Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not
responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any

carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you
access.</span></span></p>

Transfer</span></b></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Your
PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your
state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy
laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located
outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer
your PII to the United States and process it there.</span></span></p>
