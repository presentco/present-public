<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Present Privacy Policy</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Last Updated: 2/22/2017</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Collection and Use of Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Information Collected or Received from You</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Account Information. If you create an Account, we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your phone number (“<b>PII</b>”). If you create an Account through the Services, we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your Present User ID.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “<b>Log Data</b>”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “<b>User</b>”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Location Information. When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Information that We Share with Third Parties</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Shared with other Users. As part of our Services, you may communicate with other Users using the chat functionality of the Services. When you participate in a chat session, the content of your communications will be visible and available to any User participating in that session. We encourage you to use your judgment in communicating and sharing information with other Users.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers will only have access to anonymized data for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. that we use to gather information about how Users engage with our Site and Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"><span class="s2">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We also use Mixpanel to provide us with analytics data regarding Users’ and visitors interactions with our Services. You may opt-out of Mixpanel’s automatic retention of data collected while using the Services by visiting <a href="https://mixplanel.com/optout/"><span class="s2">https://mixplanel.com/optout/</span></a>. To track opt-outs, Mixpanel uses a persistent opt-out cookie placed on your device. Please note that if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter the browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers), you may clear the Mixpanel opt-out cookie.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our Users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Your Choices</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Opt-Out. We may periodically send you free communications that directly promote the Services or other services offered by Present. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication you receive. We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about your Account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Modifying Your Information. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by deleting an image by using the delete icon when viewing an image you shared. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bubble.network"><span class="s2">support@present.network</span></a> with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Services do not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The Security of Your Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Links to Other Sites</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “<b>Third-party Service</b>”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>International Transfer</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Our Policy Toward Children</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Questions?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@bubble.network"><span class="s2">support@present.network</span></a></span></p>
