and Present agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation
or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”)
will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the
right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of
a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual
property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “<b>IP
Protection Action</b>”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also
have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Present with
written notice of your desire to do so by email at <a
href="mailto:support@present.co"><span class=s2>support@present.co</span></a>
within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such
notice, an “<b>Arbitration Opt-out Notice</b>”). If you don’t provide Present
with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will
be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any
Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely
provide Present with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and
federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the
parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
Unless you timely provide Present with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <b>you
acknowledge and agree that you and Present are each waiving the right to a
trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class action or representative proceeding.</b> Further, unless both you and
Present otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be
deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute
Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Arbitration
Rules</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>The
arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”)
in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in
effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules
are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><span class=s2>www.adr.org/arb_med</span></a>
or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will
govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Arbitration
Process</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>A party
who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written
Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a
general <a
href="https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><span
class=s2>Demand for Arbitration</span></a>.) The arbitrator will be either a
retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by
the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree
upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for
Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the
AAA Rules.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Arbitration
Location and Procedure</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Unless
you and Present otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the
county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the
arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and
Present submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your
right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA
Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange
of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the
arbitration.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Arbitrator’s
Decision</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>The
arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA
Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the
arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
“Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages
for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent
necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you
prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Present will not seek,
and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover,
attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Fees</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Your
responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will
be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages
does not exceed $75,000, Present will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator
finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your
Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</span></span></p>

within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the

Present and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede
and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements
between Present and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of
these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed
pursuant to the terms of the “Dispute Resolution” section above or by court of
competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by
sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth
above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and
the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You
may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
without Present’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Present may freely
assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing,
these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors
and permitted assigns.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Any
notices or other communications provided by Present under these Terms,
including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via

of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</span></span></p>

<p class=p2><span class=s1><span style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif'>Present’s
failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered
a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision
will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
representative of Present. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the
exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be
without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</span></span></p>
